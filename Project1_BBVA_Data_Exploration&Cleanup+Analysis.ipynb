    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "* As known, one of the institutions with more information available (individually speaking), besides Google or Amazon, are financial institutions, specifically BANKS.\n",
    "* Nowadays, BBVA knows it has valuable information for its clients (e.g. investors interested to analyze the potential demand in a specific zone regarding a specific business, the analyses of consumer patterns, among others).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps\n",
    "* First, I had to get registered in order to get my secret ID for the use of BBVA's API, which I had to take into account for the handshake process to be able to get my token to be able to grant a 30 second access to its platform.\n",
    "* Once I got my token I downloaded its available data.\n",
    "* BBVA has a global and open API platform named API_Market. Its API counts with a growing catalog of products divided into: Retail accounts, business, and Data. There are two different access levels: Sandbox and Full formats. For the purpose of this analysis, I will use BBVA’s Sandbox data, which is available for unlimited time and it is free. You just have to fill out a short form and that gives you access to an individual ID.\n",
    "* PayStats, a product of the Data division, allows you to dive into BBVA cards purchase data. PayStats offers anonymized and aggregated statistical data from millions of transactions performed with BBVA cards and any other cards in BBVA POS terminals, creating a virtual map comprised of consumers' habits, demographics and origins. The data is used to describe economic flows and commercial dynamics in a given zone.\n"
